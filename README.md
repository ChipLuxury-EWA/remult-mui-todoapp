### description:
In this project I learned remult and sharpen my skilles in mui.
Remult is a fullstack framework that take care of a lot boilerplate code regerding the Entities managment (CRUD stuff)


I did not implemented loading state nor optimistic approach when the user or admin manipulating tasks
